# Creating Vote Margins for Proportional Elections in Brazil (Arthur Fisch and Natália Bueno)

Repository with R code used to calculate vote margins in general elections in Brazil (1998-2014), using TSE Repositório data. Designs that vote margin in proportional races in Brazil are becoming increasingly common. However, using electoral data in Brazil requires the researcher to make several decisions. By making this code public, we hope to join the discussion on the use of electoral data in Brazil (see references below) and help to create a common set of standards to deal with the intricacies of this type of data.

Overall, our strategy was to analyze each election separately. Since the variables and quality of the data varies by election year, several of the issues we encountered also varied by year. This makes the code longer but we hope that our results are better by treating each election separately and then combining them in a standardized dataset.

The main challenge was: DESCRIBE


Three types of vote margins: LIST
